HTML5 UDP SOCKET TESTS
======================

These first tests are using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) & [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) which are declared as dev dependencies

if required, install the mocha runtime
```shell
npm install -g mocha
```
then run the unit tests
```shell
npm test
```

Note:
> HTML5 APIs are meant to be validated on the Web platform using [testharness](https://github.com/w3c/testharness.js/)
> One goal will then be to create and/or comply to [official W3C unit tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests)
> See http://testthewebforward.org/docs/
